# BrebeufHx 4 - Python Workshop (Simple Version)

Hello there!

This is the simple version of the Python workshop.

The goal is to create a Python function that can identify your type of pizza and predict eating time, based on what you put on that pizza.

The concepts that are used are:
- variable types
- if/else statements
- functions

If you had fun with this workshop, feel free to try the [more advanced web development version of this workshop](https://github.com/TheFloatingString/bhx-4-python-web-dev), 
in which we create a web app that connects the fronend (HTML) with the backend (python).

## Running Python Online

[Repl.it](https://repl.it) offers online execution of Python code.

## Installing Python on your Computer

Python can be installed on your computer by downloading the package through the [Python Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

When the installation wizard pops up following the download, check the option to `add python to the environment PATH` **(important)**

## Running and Editing the Code with Pycharm (easier)

Pycharm is an intuitive tool to run and edit python code. PyCharm can be downloaded via its [offical website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

## Running the Code without Pycharm (harder)

If the python PATH was correctly configured during installation, you can open your command prompt (cmd on windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux)

Navigate to your python file with `cd`, to change directory. Here's a link to 
[a useful article on cmd navigation](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/).

When you arrive at the directory in which your file is in, type ```python <name of python file>``` or ```python3 <name of python file>``` for MacOS/Linux users.

If you do not like PyCharm, you can use an alternative code editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io).
